# Nextcloud on Clever Cloud
[![Clever Cloud - PaaS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Clever%20Cloud-PaaS-orange)](https://clever-cloud.com)

Production-ready deployment of [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) on Clever Cloud. Clever Cloud is an ephemeral PaaS — each deployment or restart starts from a blank VM. This repo adapts Nextcloud to that model: persistent config and data via FS Bucket symlinks, user file storage via Cellar S3 objectstore, and idempotent startup hooks that handle both first install and subsequent restarts.

## Architecture

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| **PHP Application** | Runs Nextcloud (Apache + PHP-FPM) |
| **PostgreSQL** | Main database |
| **Redis** | Distributed cache (sessions, locks) |
| **FS Bucket** | Persists `config/`, `data/`, `custom_apps/`, `themes/`, `logs/` via symlinks |
| **Cellar S3** | Objectstore for user-uploaded files (`files_primary_s3`) |

---

## Integration challenges and solutions

### Ephemeral local disk

Nextcloud writes its config to `config/config.php` and data to `data/`. Both are lost on every Clever Cloud cycle. A FS Bucket is mounted at `app/storage/` — `run.sh` creates the symlinks before any `occ` call.

### S3 objectstore

The objectstore backend cannot be enabled via `occ` post-install — it must be present in config before the first `maintenance:install`. Cellar credentials are injected via `config-git/20-objectstore.config.php`, which Nextcloud picks up automatically from `config/` using its fragmented config mechanism. All secrets come from Clever Cloud environment variables.

### Idempotent startup

`run.sh` runs on every start (`CC_PRE_RUN_HOOK`). It checks for `config/config.php` on the FS Bucket: absent → full `maintenance:install`; present → `occ upgrade` only. PostgreSQL availability is polled with `SELECT 1` before install (addon may not be immediately reachable on first deploy).

### Skeleton upload

Uploading example files via WebDAV requires Apache running and the S3 objectstore ready — neither holds true during `CC_PRE_RUN_HOOK`. `skeleton.sh` runs via `CC_RUN_SUCCEEDED_HOOK` and calls WebDAV on `localhost:$PORT` (outbound network is restricted in this hook context). A `.skeleton_done` marker on the FS Bucket containing the `instanceid` prevents re-uploads on subsequent restarts.

### Background jobs (cron)

Clever Cloud's crontab entries are stored in `/home/bas/.cache/crontab/` — a non-standard path that `crond` does not read. **Webcron mode** is enabled instead: Nextcloud triggers background jobs on each HTTP request. `clevercloud/cron.json` additionally registers a native Clever Cloud cron that curls `/cron.php` every 5 minutes as a fallback.

### Major version migration

Nextcloud blocks version skips across majors. `install.sh` resolves the target version, compares it to the installed one, and applies upgrades step by step (e.g. 30→31→32→33) before `run.sh` calls `occ upgrade`.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install -g clever-tools
clever login
```

### First deployment

```bash
bash deploy/clever-deploy.sh
```

The script provisions the PHP app, PostgreSQL, Redis, FS Bucket and Cellar, injects all environment variables, and triggers the deployment. First startup takes **2–5 minutes** (Nextcloud install + DB seed).

### Redeploy

```bash
git push origin main:master
# or
clever deploy --alias nextcloud --force
```

### Pin a Nextcloud version

```bash
clever env set NEXTCLOUD_VERSION 32.0.6 --alias nextcloud
clever deploy --alias nextcloud --force

# back to latest:
clever env unset NEXTCLOUD_VERSION --alias nextcloud
```

### Logs / SSH

```bash
clever logs --alias nextcloud
clever ssh --alias nextcloud
```

### Teardown

```bash
bash tools/clever-destroy.sh nextcloud [orga_xxx]
```

## Known warnings

These appear in Administration → Overview. All are non-blocking.

| Warning | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Code integrity** | Custom files outside Nextcloud's distribution detected (scripts, config-git, .git) — expected |
| **HSTS** | Header managed by Clever Cloud's reverse proxy, not configurable from the app |
| **PHP 8.2** | Managed by Clever Cloud via `CC_PHP_VERSION` |
| **OPcache max_accelerated_files** | `.user.ini` applies to PHP-FPM only — PHP CLI reads system config |
| **APCu missing** | `CC_PHP_EXTENSIONS=apcu` loads the extension for PHP-FPM; Nextcloud's check runs via PHP CLI where it's unavailable |
| **AppAPI** | Optional Docker-based feature, unrelated to this deployment |
| **Log errors** | `Skipping updater backup clean-up` — backup folder absent since the web updater has never run |
